				<p>I'm a tattoo-loving, raspberri pi-making, muay thai-fighting <span>Front-End Developer</span> specializing in <span>JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap, HTML5, and CSS3</span>. I also enjoy the process of wireframing with <span>Sketch and Balsamiq</span>. With a never-ending passion for wanting to learn more, I've pushed myself to learn <span>Angular 2</span> and the rest of the <span>MEAN Stack</span>.

				Whether it's managing 60 people in retail or wearing multiple hats at a startup in the edtech sector, I've demonstrated a can-do attitude everywhere that I've worked in the past. I love building websites and web applications that challenge my logical abilities and I would love doing the same for you!
